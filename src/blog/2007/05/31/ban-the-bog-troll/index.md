Officially known as [bathroom attendants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathroom_attendant), the bog troll lurks in bars and clubs, interrupting customers' casual hygiene routine by obstructing sinks and hand-dryers and extorting money for performing such mundane tasks as turning on taps and distributing paper towels.  
The bog troll is a menace. The bog troll does not encourage hygiene, it prevents it. Once the third-pint breaks the seal, regular users have no wish to pay an extra pound to offload their processed beer. With typical British manners, bathroom visitors are put in an uncomfortable position: wash their hands tax-free and risk offending the troll; or leave the bathroom unclean, hygiene-be-damned.  
Many customers choose the latter. Damn you Bog Troll! Damn you for hoarding the paper towels. Damn you for covering three sinks with CK One. Damn you and your tray of Chupa Chups.  
Please help us regulate this scourge, sign the [Ban The Bog Troll petition](http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BanTheBogTroll/) at Downing Street.  
This has been a public service announcement. Thank you.
